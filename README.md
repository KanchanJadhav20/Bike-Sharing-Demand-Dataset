* About Data Set:

This dataset is useful for analyzing bike rental patterns based on various factors such as weather, time of day, and day of the week. It can be used to understand trends and make predictions related to bike rentals.

* Problem Stement:

The task is to develop a predictive model to forecast bike rentals based on various factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and day of the week. Using historical data on bike rentals, the objective is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the total count of bike users (casual + registered) for future time periods
